"""A group of primatologists wants to study the details of the daily movement,
activities, and interactions of a group of 6 chimpanzees living on "chimp island"
-a natural, though somewhat open habitatabout 50 meters in diameter,
bounded on all sides by water, in the San-Diego zoo. Since they don't want to sit
all day every day recording the second-by second positions and activities of the chimps,
they have come to you, a computer vision expert, for automated assistance.
They are interested in both compiling statistics about the movement and location of individuals,
and in the frequency and locations of different interactions and activities
(feeding, sleeping, grooming, fighting, etc.) They are willing to help in labeling
relevant activities, even to the point of answering a few hundred quick questions per
day of data (what's she doing here?), but they don't want to sit through 24 hours of
video to do it. Ultimately they want an automated database that they can use to find
out how many hours a day chimp Jane sleeps and where, histogram preferred eating locations,
obtain statistics on who grooms whom, etc. Their equipment budget is an exceedingly generous $50K.
P.S. If you want to "bar-code" the chimps, you have to do it in a way that will bother neither the chimps, nor the visitors to the zoo.
